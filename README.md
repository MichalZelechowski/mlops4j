Repository contains MLOps solutions for Java ecosystem.

## Why MLOps in Java?

There's a lot to be done, in terms of building integrated ML systems
and continuously operating them in production, in addition to adhoc research and analysis.

Java offers:
* maturity - well established and mature ecosystem, supporting many enterprises and critical systems
* ease of maintenance - strong, statically typed language, with strong object orientation, that helps building systems ranging from small to big complexity
* popularity - there's a huge amount of excellent quality open source libraries out there

Additionally, there's a big community of Java developers that this project aims at, helping to begin journey with ML systems, by
lowering entry threshold. 

This project implements ideas behind [MLOps initiative](http://mlops.org/), using concepts described in [Google's MLOps guide](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning).
